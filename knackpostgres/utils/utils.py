def valid_pg_name(original_name):
    """
    Convert an arbitrary string into a postgres-compliant name.
    Try not too make it too ugly while you're at it.

    Warning, this opens up the possiblity that input `original_name` will
    no longer be unique to it's class instance.

    E.g., names `2-A` and `2$A` both resolve to `_2_A`.

    Best practice: label your knack fields and objects with postgres-compliant names.
