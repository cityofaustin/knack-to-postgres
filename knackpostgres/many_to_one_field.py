        one to many and many to one relationships are handled here, simply
        by adding  column to the "host" table that reference the primary key
        field of the related table. we're not using foreign keys.
    
        if the "host" table is the parent table, we append the array `[]` 
        modifier so that it can hold multiple values. good luck
        sorting that out in Hasura.

        this is a public method that must be called by the app class
        and passed down to the parent table and then fields, because
        relationships reach across tables in the app.

        this is done after all fields (except formulae) have been
        instanciated, because we need to reference the postgres
        field and table names of the relationships.
